// space complacity

// amount of memory needed in order to allocate in order to run the code in our algorithm.

    // axullary space complexity 
        // its the space required by the algorithm, not including space taken up by the inputs.

    // basic rules 
    // most premitives (booleans, numbers, undefines, null) are constant space
    //string require O(n) space (n is the string length)
    //reference types are generally O(n), where n is the length (for arrays) or the number of the keys (for objects)
